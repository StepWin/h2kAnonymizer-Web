A website to erase sensitive data from HOT2000 files for sharing.

The code contains an small XML modifier that reads all the HOT2000 files that are drag-and-dropped on the screen, and deletes their address field before downloading them as a zip file.

**All the operation is done offline, no data is sent to any StepWin server. The website is loaded directly from this repository.**

## If you would like to have it as an executable, check out the other H2K Anonymizer repository.
