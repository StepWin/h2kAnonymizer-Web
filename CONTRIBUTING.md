## Post an issue
When you are dropping the files, each file that is being read is logged in `Right-Click > Inspect Element > Console` or `Ctrl+Shift+C > Console`. If you have issues when it gets to an specific file, introducing that corner-case will immensely help with tracking down the bug.

## Post a Pull Request
Try to follow the same style. That's it! Some nice things to have:

- [ ] A CSS transition for when the file is being hovered.
- [ ] An image to make the interface nicer.
- [ ] Removing `parsed` from the global scope and more fluent pipeline.
